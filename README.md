# firstSpeciesCounterPoint
//Work in progress
The "harmonizer" program works for first species counter point excersises.
This java program uses a Linked List data structure to input your cantus firmus and melody and the program can print your intervals to check for errors. Tri Tones result in a "666."
Future tasks currently working on to add to program: methods to check for other error, a method to use a random number generator to harmonize a given cantus firmus, and a UI that can clearly show which notes user has selected and how they appear on western classical notation.
